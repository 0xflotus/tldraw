# TLDraw Development App

This Next.js app is deployed to tldraw.com. Note that changes made to the dependent packages [@tldraw/tldraw]() or [@tldraw/core]() will **not** cause this project to update. To incorporate their changes, you will need to restart the server. If you want a more efficient environment for working on the packages, see `packages/app`.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server from the repository's root folder (`/`):

```bash
yarn start:www
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
