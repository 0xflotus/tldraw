# TLDraw Development App

This app is a Snowpack app, designed to aid development of the tldraw packages ([@tldraw/core]() and [@tldraw/tldraw]()). This app is not published. If you are looking for the main app, see the folder `/www`.

## Local Development

To work on the development app:

1. Download or clone the repository.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw.git
   ```

2. Install dependencies.

   ```bash
   yarn
   ```

3. Start the development server.

   ```bash
   yarn start
   ```

4. Open the local site at `https://localhost:8080`.

While running, the app will update in response to your changes in either this folder, as well as the other two packages' folders.
